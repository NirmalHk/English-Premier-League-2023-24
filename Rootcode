# Were CFC better at home or away?

#Firstly, let's check out all the CFC home games, if the result is:


WITH home_results AS (
select f.FT ,f.HomeTeam , count(f.FT) as results
from footy_data f
where HomeTeam = "Chelsea"
group by f.FT, f.HomeTeam) 

Select FT, HomeTeam,
CASE
WHEN FT = "D" THEN (results*1)
WHEN FT = "H" THEN (results*3)
ELSE (results*0)
END AS POINTS
FROM home_results;


# Now let's do the same for the Away Chelsea matches, here the logic reverse as "H" counts as a LOSS and "A" counts as a WIN.

WITH home_results AS (
select f.FT ,f.AwayTeam , count(f.FT) as results
from footy_data f
where AwayTeam = "Chelsea"
group by f.FT, f.AwayTeam) 

Select FT, AwayTeam, results,
CASE
WHEN FT = "D" THEN (results*1)
WHEN FT = "A" THEN (results*3)
ELSE (results*0)
END AS POINTS
FROM home_results
