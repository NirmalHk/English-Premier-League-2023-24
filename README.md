# English-Premier-League-2023-24
Welcome to my person project! This will be mainly used to practise data analysis and SQL to generate insights on PL data from the 2023/24 season. My favourite team is Chelsea Football club, even though we've been through a lot, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world! I'll be playing around with data to answer few interesting problems inclduing how teams fared at home V/s away and also we will finally find out whether Anthony Taylor has an agenda against Chelsea! ( Bald ref famous for this thing btw). There will be more questions answered as the days go on, i'll find new questions to answer as I study the data more.

I got the data from : https://data.world/evangower/english-premier-league-2022-23-match-data/discuss/j7ka6sr3#nmbvfeij
The abbrevations are pretty clear to a football nerd like me but there's a txt file below that should help you out:

PS. This has some weird betting data that's not gonna be useful for most people (don't gamble mate.)
