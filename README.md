# English-Premier-League-2023-24
Welcome to my person project! This will be mainly used to practise data analysis and SQL to generate insights on PL data from the 2023/24 season. My favourite team is Chelsea Football club, even though we've been through a lot, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world! I'll be playing around with data to answer few interesting problems inclduing how teams fared at home V/s away and also we will finally find out whether Anthony Taylor has an agenda against Chelsea! ( Bald ref famous for this thing btw). There will be more questions answered as the days go on, i'll find new questions to answer as I study the data more.

I got the data from : https://football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2324/all-euro-data-2023-2024.xlsx
The abbrevations are pretty clear to a football nerd like me but there's a txt file below that should help you out:

PS. This has some weird betting data that's not gonna be useful for most people (don't gamble mate.)



Firstly, let's take a look at Chelsea football club themselves and see where we lost all the points:

Were CFC better at home or away?

Firstly, let's check out all the CFC home games, if the result is:
 A- Away win = LOSS.  
 H- Home win = WIN , 
 D= DRAW. 
 Also let's make things more interesting, points scored will be:  win = 3 pts, Draw= 1pt and Loss = 0 pts.

We can see that there's a clear majority of wins at Stamford Bridge (Home) with 11 W's and 4 a piece for losses and draws. Around 37 points were scored at HOME.

Now let's do the same for the Away Chelsea matches:
