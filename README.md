# English-Premier-League-2023-24
Welcome to my person project! This will be mainly used to practise data analysis and SQL to generate insights on PL data from the 2023/24 season. My favourite team is Chelsea Football club, even though we've been through a lot, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world! I'll be playing around with data to answer few interesting problems inclduing how teams fared at home V/s away and also we will finally find out whether Anthony Taylor has an agenda against Chelsea! ( Bald ref famous for this thing btw).
